## Deployment Security Considerations

### Production Security Requirements

⚠️ **CRITICAL: Change Default API Keys Before Production Deployment**

The following default API keys are included in the repository for development purposes and **MUST be changed** before any production deployment:

- **Default User Key**: `user-key-456`
- **Default Admin Key**: `admin-key-123`

**Action Required:**
1. Generate new secure API keys using a cryptographically secure random generator
2. Update environment variables in production deployment
3. Never commit production API keys to version control
4. Use secrets management systems (AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, etc.)

### Known Issues and Resolutions

#### ✅ Resolved Issues

1. **SQL Injection Protection**: Implemented comprehensive input validation and parameterized queries
2. **XSS Protection**: Added content security policies and input sanitization
3. **Container Security**: Dockerfile creates non-root user "appuser" for secure container execution
4. **Health Checks**: Backend health check implemented at `/health` endpoint
5. **CORS Configuration**: Proper CORS settings for cross-origin requests
6. **Rate Limiting**: Implemented rate limiting to prevent abuse
7. **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation for all API endpoints

#### ⚠️ Known Issues (Development/Prototype Phase)

1. **Feedback Endpoint Security**: The feedback endpoint currently has no authentication
   - **Impact**: Low (prototype phase)
   - **Recommendation**: Implement authentication if deployed publicly
   - **Status**: Acceptable for development, needs review for production

2. **Default API Keys**: Hardcoded default keys in repository
   - **Impact**: High if deployed with defaults
   - **Status**: Must be changed before production deployment

3. **Frontend Health Check**: No dedicated health check endpoint
   - **Impact**: Low (Next.js serves static files)
   - **Status**: Acceptable, can use root path `/` for health checks

### Container Security

#### ✅ Implemented Security Measures

1. **Non-Root User**: Dockerfile creates and uses non-root user "appuser"
2. **Minimal Base Images**: Uses official Python and Node.js Alpine images
3. **Multi-Stage Builds**: Reduces attack surface in production images
4. **Health Checks**: Comprehensive health monitoring
5. **Resource Limits**: Container resource constraints
6. **Secrets Management**: Environment variables for configuration

#### File Permissions

The Dockerfile ensures proper file permissions:
- Application files owned by non-root user
- Read permissions for configuration files
- Write permissions only for necessary directories (logs, cache)

### Environment-Specific Security

#### Development Environment
- **API Keys**: Default keys acceptable for local development
- **Authentication**: Minimal for rapid prototyping
- **Logging**: Verbose logging for debugging
- **CORS**: Permissive for local development

#### Production Environment
- **API Keys**: Must use secure, randomly generated keys
- **Authentication**: Full authentication required
- **Logging**: Structured logging with sensitive data filtering
- **CORS**: Restrictive CORS policies
- **HTTPS**: TLS/SSL encryption required
- **Secrets Management**: Use external secrets management

## Security Features

### Authentication & Authorization

- **JWT-based authentication** with configurable expiration
- **Role-based access control (RBAC)** for fine-grained permissions
- **Multi-factor authentication (MFA)** support
- **Session management** with secure token storage
- **Password policies** with complexity requirements

### API Security

- **Rate limiting** to prevent abuse and DDoS attacks
- **Input validation** and sanitization for all endpoints
- **SQL injection protection** through parameterized queries
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) protection** with content security policies
- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection**

### Infrastructure Security

- **TLS/SSL encryption** for all communications
- **Secrets management** using Kubernetes secrets and external vaults
- **Network security** with private subnets and security groups
- **Container security** with non-root users and minimal base images
- **Regular security updates** and patch management

### Data Protection

- **Encryption at rest** for all sensitive data
- **Encryption in transit** using TLS 1.3
- **Data anonymization** for analytics and logging
- **Backup encryption** and secure storage
- **Data retention policies** with automatic cleanup

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Code Review**: All code changes must be reviewed by at least one other developer
2. **Security Scanning**: Automated security scans run on every pull request
3. **Dependency Management**: Regular updates of dependencies with security patches
4. **Input Validation**: Validate and sanitize all user inputs
5. **Error Handling**: Avoid exposing sensitive information in error messages
6. **Logging**: Log security events without exposing sensitive data

### For Administrators

1. **Access Control**: Use least privilege principle for all access
2. **Monitoring**: Monitor for suspicious activities and anomalies
3. **Backup Security**: Encrypt and secure all backups
4. **Incident Response**: Follow incident response procedures
5. **Regular Audits**: Conduct regular security audits and assessments

### For Users

1. **Strong Passwords**: Use strong, unique passwords
2. **MFA**: Enable multi-factor authentication when available
3. **Session Management**: Log out when finished and use secure connections
4. **Phishing Awareness**: Be aware of phishing attempts
5. **Reporting**: Report suspicious activities immediately
